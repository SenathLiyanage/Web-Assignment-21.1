    <p><h3>Land is a fundamental resource for dignified human living, primarily for safer dwelling in this era. It is required for developing a number of socio-economic sectors too, such as agriculture, forestry, irrigation, plantation, and industries, apart from the need for other large-scale physical infrastructures such as highways and powerplants. As we are aware, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is one of the key assessments carried out in any of the feasibility studies for development projects. Engineers responsible for designing infrastructure development projects are one of the key stakeholders in the land use planning, which also make them as key decision makers in the sustainable use of land while protecting
 the ecosystems and biodiversity.<h3></p>

<p>Every SDG needs engineers. How can engineers contribute to attain Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 – ‘Life on land’, which is to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. The SDG 15 deals with three main aspects: managing forests, preserving biodiversity, and combating desertification. The Clause 3 of the code of ethics for professional engineers by the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL) clearly articulates that “Engineers shall be committed to the need for sustainable management of the planet’s resources and seek to minimize adverse environmental impacts of their engineering works or applications of technology so as to protect both present and future generations”. This code is a good example for the utmost important given in the engineering profession for three key aspects of SDG15 mentioned above.</p>
