    <p>Land is a fundamental resource for dignified human living, primarily for safer dwelling in this era. It is required for developing a number of socio-economic sectors too, such as agriculture, forestry, irrigation, plantation, and industries, apart from the need for other large-scale physical infrastructures such as highways and powerplants. As we are aware, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is one of the key assessments carried out in any of the feasibility studies for development projects. Engineers responsible for designing infrastructure development projects are one of the key stakeholders in the land use planning, which also make them as key decision makers in the sustainable use of land while protecting
 the ecosystems and biodiversity.<p>
