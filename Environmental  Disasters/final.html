<h2><font size="5" color="blue">What is the Land Pollution</font></h2>
<p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth’s land surfaces, at and below ground level. The cause is the accumulation of solid and liquid waste 
materials that contaminate groundwater and soil. These waste materials are often referred to as municipal solid waste (MSW), which includes both hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste.</P>
<break>
<p>When waste is deposited onto an area of land, the permeability of the soil formations below the waste can increase or reduce the risk of land pollution. The higher 
the permeability of the soil, the more likely that land pollution will occur. That’s why the Texas Disposal Systems Landfill, located just outside of Austin, Texas,
 was built in an ideal area. By utilizing the natural shale and clay in the land, the risk of land pollution has been significantly decreased.It wasn’t until the 
mid-20th century that solid wastes were collected with the environment in mind. Prior to that, waste was typically left on top of the ground in “open dumps,” which 
resulted in rats, mosquitoes, and other disease infestations, as well as foul smells and windblown debris. Yet, while there are now significantly safer practices for 
disposing of waste, there are still many other factors contributing to and worsening the situation.</p>

<p>What is land destruction?  Land destruction involves many different things.  It can be logging of trees and rain forest.  Nuclear waste is one that is very serious
 that is harmful to the land.  As well, pollution, air, water and land all do damage of some kind.  Land destruction is something that doesn’t need to be taking 
lightly.  There are many other items such as building and dams that cause damage to the land as well.  This is a topic that needs to be addressed and fixed.  
 All of this items listed above are dreadful to the land.   Land destruction needs to be stopped and taken care of before it goes to far to stop.
Land destruction is an umbrella term for cards or deck strategies that eliminate enemy lands in an effort to deprive them of the resources they need to cast spells. 
Land destruction may appear on single-target removal effects or on mass removal effects that eliminate all lands simultaneously.</p>

<p>While there are many causes of land pollution, here are a few of the main contributors:</p>
<h3><u>Litter</u></h3>
<p>Littering, the improper disposal of waste products, is unfortunately common. Every cigarette butt tossed on the ground or food wrapper tossed out of a car window is
 a small contribution to a monumental issue. According to Keep America Beautiful, <b>76% of litter found on roadways</b> is from pedestrians and motorists. Not all litter,
 however, is intentional. A large volume of litter also comes from unsecured items that fall off the back of vehicles or out of trash receptacles.All litter, whether 
intentional or not, causes pollution by releasing chemicals and microparticles as it degrades. Check out our blog post on littering to learn more about the effects of
 littering and how to reduce it in your community.</p>
<h3><u>Urbanization and Construction</u></h3>
<p>While urbanization is not in itself littering, large quantities of people living, producing trash and littering in a dense area does inevitably lead to land pollution. 
To accommodate this increased population, construction activities also occur, which result in large waste materials, such as metal, plastic, wood, and bricks. When 
these materials are not properly disposed of, it contributes to the land pollution of that area. 
To help reduce the environmental impact of construction sites, it’s important to work with partners that offer comprehensive <em>builder solutions</em> to achieve cost-effective
 construction recycling and waste disposal plans.</p>
<h3><u>Mining</u></h3>
<p>Mining is the extraction of minerals and other geological materials from the ground, which are then used for a wide range of purposes, including but not limited to,
 producing gasoline for automobiles, generating electricity, and selling materials such as gold and silver. This extraction and the methods used, however, deplete the 
earth of its natural resources and cause damage and pollution in its wake. That’s why finding alternatives for energy <em>(think solar and wind power)</em> that aren’t mined 
from the earth’s surface are so vital in helping to reduce land pollution moving forward.</p>
 
<h2><font size="5" color="blue">How the Destruction of the Land Effects Human</font></h2>
<p>Soil pollution can harm public health and animals, as well as the quality of groundwater and surface water. Its effects are of several kinds, namely deferred or
 immediate, but also direct or indirect.
The potential effects of soil contamination on human health include breathing disorders, birth defects, skin diseases, and cancer.Land pollution touches essentially
 every area of the living world, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water that isn’t safe to drink</p\li>
<li>Polluted soil, which leads to a loss of fertile land for agriculture</li>
<li>Climate change, which causes an onslaught of disastrous problems, including flash floods and irregular rainfalls</li> 
<li>The endangerment and extinction of species in wildlife</li>
<li>Habitat shifting, where some animals are forced to flee where they live in order to survive</li>
<li>An increase in wildfires, due to polluted areas often becoming very dry</li>
<li>Increased air pollution, which burning waste contributes to</li>
</ul>

<h2><font size="5" color="blue">How to Prevent Land Pollution</font></h2>
<p>Given the disastrous effects of land pollution, taking preventive measures to reduce its impact moving forward is crucial.</p>

<h3><u>Using Fewer Pesticides and Chemicals in Agriculture</u></h3>
<p>Given that the use of pesticides and chemicals in farming and agriculture greatly contribute to land pollution, finding alternatives will help to reduce the environmental
 impact. Farmers, for instance, can use natural ingredients by switching from bio-fertilizers to manure. 
On the individual level, supporting environmentally-conscious, local farmers at your closest farmer’s market or local grocery store can help to build up business for 
farmers with more sustainable farming practices. Another option is to contribute to or volunteer in an urban garden in your neighborhood.</p>
<h3><u>Reforestation</u></h3>
<p>Reforestation involves replanting an area with trees. This can be needed for areas that have experienced wildfires, for instance, or where trees had been chopped 
down and milled. This process helps to bind the soil, which helps to protect it from land pollution and prevents soil erosion and flooding.</p>
<h3><u>Reduce, Reuse and Recycle</u></h3>
<p>At the individual level, there are many things we can do to reduce our contribution to land pollution. One of the simplest ways to do this is to reuse or recycle 
items so that you aren’t creating waste out of a material or item that still has a purpose. With the growing awareness around <b>what can be recycled</b> and an increase in
 recycling bins in many cities, it has never been easier to recycle.
